### [28\. Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


Implement .

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or **-1** if needle is not part of haystack.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

**Clarification:**

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when `needle` is an empty string. This is consistent to C's  and Java's .


#### Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        return haystack.indexOf(needle);
    }
}
```
